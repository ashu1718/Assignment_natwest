created weather app using html css and javascript.
used openWhether API to fetch data.
created a UI with an input box to input city name.
also added an checkbox to select if desired temperature is in Celcius.
also added a div of last five searched cities as a button so that user can again go to previous searched cities.
in this div all cities will be unique, i.e, thier will be no repeatation of city name.
it only shows last five unique searched cities name.
if the name is not valid then a pop is shown with the message.
